# Project: WorkAround Explorer

Hello!

I'm Bianca, and this project is part of the Codecademy course **"Learn Intermediate JavaScript."**

WorkAround is a fictonal research organization that provides data on salary trends in the tech industry and now wants to release a new web application called WorkAround Explorer to make their data more easily viewable. This web app allows users to choose specific roles and companies in the tech industry to view the following information:

- The salary for the chosen role at the chosen company.
- The industry average for the chosen role.
- The average salary at the chosen company across all roles.
- The industry average salary across all roles and all companies.

My task in this project was to help the team members out by using my `import` and `export` expertise!

Feel free to check the result =)
